The purpose of this project is to automate announcements for employees into an email. Through this package there are four modules. The modules allow access to employees and their information as well as the ability to extract their user ID and email from their information. Lastly, there is a function that allows you to send emails to multiple people or a single person. This resolves the issue of needing to send out emails manually.
